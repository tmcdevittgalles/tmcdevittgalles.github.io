# Travis McDevitt-Galles
I am an ecologist interested in diesease ecology and species interactions. I am currently a PhD canidate in Dr. Pieter Johnson's lab at the University of Colorado: Boulder where I am addressing how variation in seasonal weather patterns shape intensity dependent pathology in an amphibian-trematode system as well as identifty the non-infectious roles of parasites in ecosystems.
